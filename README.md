## What is Hack With Me?

Hack With Me  is an annual 2-day coding hackathon for high school students that happens in August. Students join to create projects, solve problems, and improve their coding skills.

The goal of Hack With Me is to make hackathons accessible to everyone. Thatâ€™s why this year, we aim to bring together 300 high school students to share their ideas and showcase their talents.
